            Most FIRST robotics teams will participate in some form of outreach. Itâ€™s most often an act of spreading the message of STEM. As FIRST is founded upon the concept of having students critically think and apply STEM concepts. Outreach is a very broad term, as the term can be applied to an Instagram page just as easily as a robotics event. Even though there are multiple forms of outreach, Harlem Rails attempts to help the STEM community in any way possible.
